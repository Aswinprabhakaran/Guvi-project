# Guvi-project
Actualy my project is an simple sign in page.
Onclicking the Sign-in button my page would traverse to another page were the user could see his confirmation on his login.
on that page i have made some spectial things to look-a-like an realtime login page.Hence  to make that page more beautiful, i have use many contents on Bootstrap.
Also i have another page for registration,where the user on his sign-up can verify his confirmation.
Since this is my first web project, it was very challenging to me.
